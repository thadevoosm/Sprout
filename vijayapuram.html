    Society collaborates with 
    Startups to promote 
    Biodegradable Products </p>
    The Roman Catholic Diocese of Vijayapuram in Kerala has been actively working 
    towards socio-economic and educational development interventions for the past 61 
    years through its social apostolate - Vijayapuram Social Service Society (VSSS). The 
    organization has been striving for the integral development of the poor and 
    marginalized people in the operational area and has collaborated with various 
    agencies to fight for ecological balance and restoration.
    As part of their commitment towards ecological issues, VSSS has collaborated with 
    two new startups - SPROUT GROUP and THOOSAN to replace plastic with 
    biodegradable material products like carry bags, straws, plates, etc. The collaboration 
    aims to promote sustainable development and ecological balance in the society.
    To promote awareness among the younger generation, VSSS organized a 
    competition among Balaveedi Students on the need for replacing plastic with 
    degradable materials. The event was held on August 13, 2022, at the VSSS 
    auditorium, Mount Carmel church campus, and the winners were awarded cash prizes 
    of Rs.3,000, Rs.2,000, and Rs.1,000 for the first, second, and third prize, respectively.
    SPROUT GROUP and THOOSAN are new startups supported by international and 
    national agencies to bring a cutlery revolution in the society for an eco-friendly 
    atmosphere. They aim to provide a replacement for the current disposable plastic 
    utensils on the market, which end up in landfills every year after being used once.
    To promote their mission, VSSS in collaboration with SPROUT GROUP and THOOSAN 
    organized a product launch event named KSHITHI 2022. The event provided a 
    platform to showcase the alternative products for single-use plastics, and the startups 
    were able to connect with experts, industry leaders, and policymakers.
    The collaboration between VSSS, SPROUT GROUP, and THOOSAN is a significant 
    step towards promoting sustainable development and ecological balance. The 
    initiative will go a long way in creating a better, cleaner, and more sustainable world 
    for future generations.</p>
