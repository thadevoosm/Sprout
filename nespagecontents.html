                    Maldives Takes a Bold Step to 
Ban Single-Use Plastics from 
2023 to Save its Fragile 
Ecosystem</p>
                    <p> The Maldives government has taken a bold step in the fight against plastic pollution 
                        by announcing a nationwide ban on single-use plastics from 2023. The ban is part of 
                        the country's efforts to protect its fragile ecosystem and promote sustainable tourism.
                        The Maldives, a nation of 1,200 islands, is known for its pristine beaches, crystal-clear 
                        waters, and vibrant marine life. However, the country's tourism industry, which is the 
                        main source of income, has also contributed to the growing problem of plastic 
                        pollution. According to a study conducted by the World Bank, the Maldives generates 
                        around 330 tons of plastic waste per day, with 90% of it ending up in the ocean.<br>
