              <p >To minimize our impact on the environment, we apply a life-cycle approach and use applicable 
                environmental technologies. We strive to save natural resources by using raw materials, energy

                home compostable, and also repulpable. We commit to use GMP (good manufacturing practice) and 
                defined in-house controlling verified by third parties in our production of food contact 
                materials.</p> 
                
                <p>We support sustainable forest management and we use Chain of Custody tracing systems for ran 
                  materials to ensure that all of the wood raw material and pulp originates for legal and approved 
                  sources We also require that our raw material suppliers commit to the requirements of our Chain

            <p class="history_p ">We believe in doing business in a way that is fair, transparent and, above all, 
              safe and sustainable. These are the fundamentals of responsible practice. Without them we cannot
               build the trust and good faith on which we trade. <br>
              At Sprout Group we know that a responsible business is a sustainable business. We take our 
              responsibilities seriously - and none more so than health and safety. No other matter - commercial 
              or operational - takes precedence over the well being of those involved in or affected by our 
              activities. <br>
              We have set ourselves the target of eliminating all accidents from our operations. This is an 
              ambitious goal. But we are confident we can achieve it through the commitment of all our people 
              to put health and safety first in everything they do. While this is - and will remain our greatest 
              priority, we recognize that our responsibilities extend beyond this. To ensure our sustainability 
              agenda delivers maximum value, we begin by understanding the role we are expected to play 
              in dealing with the social, economic and environmental challenges of our time. <br>
              Modern society is changing at a pace not seen since the industrial revolution. While the world’s 
              population rises exponentially, major demographic shifts are transforming global dynamics. As 
              businesses strive for commercial sustainability in challenging conditions, they must at the same 
              time respond to a new economic framework where competitive advantage is determined by the social 
              and environmental dividends of their operations. <br>
              The way we manage these interconnected issues will have a material impact on the success of our 
              business. But if we are to achieve our objectives, we must be honest about the scale of the 
              undertaking. committed to finding the right solutions and prepared to admit we don't have all the 
              answers.</p>
               
              <p class="subheading_main">How We Structure Our Activities</p>
                <p>Our sustainability agenda is organized into four key areas:</p>
                <p>Health and safety, people, environment and marketplace. In our Indian hub our sustainability activities are known as our EPIC agenda. Against each of these components, we have set clear targets and expectations that focus our activities on the areas where we can make the most positive impact or where risk of negative consequences, if not adequately addressed, is greatest.</p>

               management techniques.Underlying this focus is the 
              H&S Strategic Direction. This defines the actions and focus of leadership and management in providing effective oversight and management 
              of H&S at all levels across the business in the following areas:</p>
                 <p class="subheading">Disciplined Delivery</p>
                 <p class="history_p">Supporting the embedment of the Global Minimum Requirements(GMs)
                   in achieving a more discipline and consistent delivery model.
                  </p>
                  
                    <p class="subheading">Strong Risk Management</p>
                    <p class="history_p">Transforming people's relationship with H&S by empowering them to care and manage risk through informed judgement.</p>
                      <p class="subheading">Driving Innovation</p>
                      <p class="history_p">Utilizing the innovation pathway to provide focus and direction to solutions that can positively affect safety outcomes. We also remain committed to ensuring our operations remain focused and engaged and to reviewing the composition of the function to ensure we remain as effective as possible in executing this strategy. Although we operate in a dynamic environment and changes will be made to enhance our strategy, the H&S Strategic Direction is resolute and focused in these areas.<br><br>
                        Achieving this aspiration relies on the implementation of a simple and effective framework that assists our day-to-day decision making and helps our business function safely. Our 2018 GMRs drive this approach across five stages of the operational life cycle. These include governance, investment, design and planning, establishing work environments and delivery, setting parameters on the control and elimination of key risk events faced by our business. There is a deliberate focus on front-end planning and strong risk management meaning that safety begins for Sprout Group well before a project commences and irrespective of the working environment.<br><br>
                        The H&S Strategic Direction and GMR Framework are essential components in ensuring the safety, health and well being of our people remains our priority. This approach also empowers people to identify and manage H&S risks that are applicable to them, promotes moving beyond minimum statutory and organisational requirements, and leads to innovation and continual improvement. They are all key attributes in our aspiration to create places that care and which are free from incident and injury.</p>
