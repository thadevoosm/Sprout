<p class="tropy">Sprout Group's Biodegradable 
    Solution Accepted for The SUP 
    Challenge - Goa </p>
    <p>Sprout Group's innovative solution to the problem of single-use plastic waste has 
    been selected for The SUP Challenge - Goa. The challenge, organized by The 
    Incubation Network and funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic 
    Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and ECCA Family Foundation, aims to 
    accelerate startups in South and Southeast Asia to pilot their solutions with the F&B 
    industry to reduce single-use plastic waste.
    Sprout Group's biodegradable alternative to the SUP coating has been developed 
    using agricultural waste, including cellulose-rich fruit and vegetable waste, and 
    cornstarch. Their solution caught the attention of Climate Collective, who found it to 
    be noteworthy and recommended it for the SUP Challenge.
    As part of the challenge, eight Entrepreneur Support Organizations (ESOs) will 
    receive at least US$50,000 in funding and technical assistance to support their 
    projects from April until September 2022. The cohort will also contribute their 
    experience and best practices towards a Technical Assistance Playbook for ESOs 
    developed by The Incubation Network.
    The results of the pilots will contribute to a study around understanding the 
    environmental impacts of alternatives to single-use plastic packaging. This will outline 
    the environmental considerations associated with single-use replacement business 
    models and the opportunities to reduce negative impacts or recognize carbon 
    savings, relative to virgin plastic production.
    The SUP Challenge - Goa presents a fantastic opportunity for Sprout Group to 
    showcase their innovative solution and make a significant impact on reducing single use plastic waste. We wish them all the best for their participation in the challenge 
    and look forward to seeing the results of their pilot project.</p>
