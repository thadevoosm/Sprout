    Ekopana Samithi Urges 
    Retailers to Use Biodegradable 
    Paper Cups in Wake of Plastic 
    Ban </p>
    <p>The Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi has released a press notice urging all 
    retailers and distributors in Kerala to use Sprout Greenpak paper cups, which are 
    biodegradable, home compostable, and recyclable. The notice comes in the wake of 
    a ban on single-use plastic products in Kerala since January 2020.
    The association strictly prohibits the sale of any banned single-use paper products 
    and will not offer any assistance to those caught selling them. The association is 
    promoting the use of only eco-friendly products and is asking all sellers in Kerala to 
    sell only biodegradable paper cups.
    The government of Kerala has banned the use of plastic-coated paper cups as they 
    are harmful to health and the environment. The ban has prompted the Kerala Vyapari 
    Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi to urge all traders in the state to switch to eco-friendly 
    products.
    "Kerala has always been at the forefront of promoting eco-friendly products and 
    practices. The ban on plastic-coated paper cups is a step in the right direction 
    towards a cleaner and healthier environment," said the association during the press 
    meet.
    Sprout Greenpak paper cups are approved by the government of Kerala and are 
    made from biodegradable materials. They are also home compostable, which means 
    they can be disposed of safely at home. The cups are also recyclable, making them a 
    perfect alternative to plastic-coated paper cups.
    The Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi's call to use only eco-friendly products 
    is a step in the right direction towards a cleaner and greener Kerala. The association's 
    strict enforcement of the ban on banned single-use paper products is commendable 
    and should be supported by all stakeholders in the state.
